    <p>But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it could all fall apart. In this article, you'll
        learn about a few of our favorites.

        Mayan Doomsday
        Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new 5,126-year era after 2012, and doesn't actually
        predict a life-ending apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about virtually everything
        else, why should we trust them on this?
        Robot Takeover
        Not quite as frightening as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead Takeover, a robot rebellion is still a disquieting
        thought. We are already outnumbered by our technological gadgets, and even Bill Gates fears the day his Japanese
        robot slave turns him over by the ankles and asks (in a suitably robotic voice) "Who's your daddy now?"predict a
        life-ending apocalypse. But given that the long-dead Mayans were wrong about virtually everything
        else, why should we trust them on this?

    html5中新增加的语义化标签：
    header、footer、nav(导航)、section(区域)、article(文章)、aside(文章中的标注)、figure(文章中的配图)、figcaption(配图下面的文字)...
    在IE6~8下不兼容：只需要在IE9以下引入html5.js即可，html5.js只能兼容上述H5中的语义标签
    为了增加SEO搜索引擎的优化，我们目前不仅仅移动端采用这些标签，我们的pc端也开始使用这些标签了
